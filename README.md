This website is currently mainly a test page that displays nifty animated fish.
Each fish is a random color and at a random "depth" from the viewer. A sense of
depth is provided through varying the fish size and speed relative to depth.

The fish graphic is the SVG for the fish emoji (U+1F41F) copied from
[Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji), which is licensed under the MIT
license by Twitter.

All other components of this site are licensed under the MIT license by
